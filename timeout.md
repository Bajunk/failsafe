## Timeouts

[Timeouts][Timeout] allow you to fail an execution with `TimeoutExceededException` if it takes too long to complete:

```java
Timeout<Object> timeout = Timeout.of(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
```

You can also cancel an execution and perform an optional [interrupt] if it times out:

```
timeout.withCancel(shouldInterrupt);
```

If a cancellation is triggered by a `Timeout`, the execution is still completed with `TimeoutExceededException`. See the [execution cancellation](#execution-cancellation) section for more on cancellation.
